# PHPFaker

PHPFaker is a package that generates random fake data for you.

Requirements:

* PHP >= 5.3

To use it simply create a new faker object and then call a subclass & method.

eg:
	
	<?php
		// Do this so it can find the classes needed
        spl_autoload_register(function($class) {
            $classFile = str_replace('\\', '/', $class);
            require_once __DIR__ . '/../lib/' . $classFile . '.php';
        });
		// Create new faker object
		$faker = new PHPFaker\Faker();
		// Output a random name
		echo $faker->name->name;
	?>

Based on original Caius Durling faker library (http://github.com/caius/php-faker)
